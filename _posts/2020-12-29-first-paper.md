I am here now taking a break from the revision before resubmitting it (for the third time). Should have I submitted it first? Probably, but I fell off my bike and I need a break.

For full disclosure, this is not about my first publication. I have some papers about psychometrics or staff sizing, but they are not really "mine". I wasn't passionate about them. This post is about the first publication I am proud of. My supervisor and I had an idea during the 2019 CogSci conference about a formal model of proactive behavior and, just for fun, he started playing with toy models. We spent the end of 2019 writing the first version of the paper. 
It's true that I was completely lost when I start working on this project. I almost gave up on it several times. In the first submission, I really just helped with the general idea and minor revisions. I've spend 3 months with exclusive dedication to this project to start understanding the code. The only thing in my mind was "I am wasting the time of my supervisor". I had several questions. Most of them were stupid and could be easily solved learning a bit of programming but some of them were genuine, theoretically relevant questions. Since I couldn't distinguish them, I have just hold them to myself. It took me another 3 months to be able to externalize them. I felt stupid and, even behind a camera, it took me a while before being comfortable exposing my stupidity. It turned out that, between a thousand questions, one gotta be a decent question.
From then on, my learning progress was... still not noticeable. I was still frustrated and some questions only made me more confused. In the second submission, I was still lost but I could at least understand specific parts of the model. I was so happy this was over. But of course this was not over. Of course I am still here preparing the third submission. Will it be published? At this point, I don't even care anymore. I am just happy that now I can sincerely say I feel confident about modelling.

One year have past to make understand how much I have learned.
Yet, the more I learn, the more I rest assured that I know nothing.
